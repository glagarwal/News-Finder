* URL to access my NewsFinder: http://uml.cs.uga.edu:8080/newsfinder_gaurav_agarwal/

* The static index.html page calls the result.jsp page.
* The result.jsp page calls the NewsFinder.java program.
* The NewsFinder.java program calls the News API using restEasy.
* The results are displayed by javascript.
